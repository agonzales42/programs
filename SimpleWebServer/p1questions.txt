Program 1 Questions:
1.) Estimate the time it will take you to do the assignment, to within a quarter-hour:

	3.5 hours.

2.) Estimate the time it took you to complete the assignment..

	Thought/Design: 3 hours
	Programming: 2.5 hours
	Debugging: 1.5 hours
	TOTAL: 7 hours

3.) Percent accuracy:
	
	50%


Also:
	I am working on a Windows machine in Visual Studio Code, as opposed to Eclipse,
	and due to poor time estimation and my unfamiliarity with ant,
	I was unable to test build.xml (But I did give it a serious try).
	The build file I have provided is based on a sample that combines examples
	from classmates and online manuals and forums.
